LOOPS PART 1 
______________
We use loops when : 
When a user is playing a game and has 3 lives 
When someone enters their password incorrectly and needs to try again (but maybe only 5x before theyâ€™re locked out of their account!)
While scrolling down your newsfeed, load more posts

When else might we use a loop?
While loop:
while (condition is true) {
	// block of code to be repeated
}

For Loop:
for (a predefined number of times) {
	// block of code to be repeated



A while loop repeats a block of code while a condition is true
When the condition is no longer met, we break out of the loop

++ is equivalent to +1 in code block
+= is equivalent
